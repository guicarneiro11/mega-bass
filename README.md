# Mega Bass - Android Bass Guitar App
## About the Project
I developed Mega Bass, a bass guitar emulator for Android that integrates an audio engine with an interactive interface. Built with native technologies, it delivers realistic sound and responsive feedback for a natural playing experience.

## Key Features
- 🎸 Complete bass neck interface with 22 frets
- 🎵 4 strings with distinct sounds (G, D, A, E) and different thickness
- 🎧 Audio engine integration:
  - High-quality sound samples
  - Multiple kit selection options
  - Low latency response
- 🎯 Visual feedback system:
  - String vibration animations
  - Touch effects with color variations
  - Visual positioning indicators
- 🔄 Neck navigation system:
  - Position control via slider
  - Dynamic fret scaling
  - Smooth position transitions
- 🎚️ Playback controls:
  - Sustain button for note duration control
  - Stop All function for immediate pause
  - Recording with background tracks
  - Audio mixing with FFmpeg

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Kotlin with C++ audio processing
- **Custom Views**: 
  - Custom rendering and animation
  - Visual state management
  - Touch event handling
- **Architecture**: 
  - Native audio integration
  - State management
  - Thread-safe processing
- **Audio Processing**:
  - C++ audio engine (Oboe)
  - Thread synchronization
  - WAV asset management
- **Animations**:
  - Custom animations with ValueAnimator
  - String vibration modeling
  - Responsive visual effects

## Technical Highlights
- Integration between Java/Kotlin UI and C++ audio:
  - JNI bridge for cross-language communication
  - Memory management
  - Thread-safe audio processing
- Touch handling system:
  - Multi-touch support
  - Simultaneous string detection
  - Position translation to notes
- Kit management:
  - Dynamic sound loading
  - Web-based kit repository
  - Persistent preferences
- Recording features:
  - Audio mixing with FFmpeg
  - Background track synchronization
  - Multiple export options

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Audio Engine Integration**
   - Integration with C++ audio engine
   - Thread synchronization for stability
   - JNI memory management
2. **Touch Response Coordination**
   - Mapping touch events to audio triggers
   - Synchronizing visuals with audio
   - Sustain mode management
3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient sound loading
   - Optimized animations
   - Smooth kit switching
